For week 2

Code the convolution for realistic IRF (Gaussian with added noise) - Generate single exponential with random parameters - Convolve and add noise

Code the iterative convolution - Inputs are IRF and guesses for initial parameters

For upcoming weeks

how to generate synthetic data for FLIM and TCSPC

Differentiating between single exponential and multiexponential

How to guess the initial parameters
