# ml-as-tcspc-prediction-tool

This is the code used to predict TCSPC parameters using ML. This can be used as an aid for iterative convolution or without iterative convolution.

The code is unorganised for now. However close examination of the code should be fairly straight forward.

The ML code is available in colab folder.
